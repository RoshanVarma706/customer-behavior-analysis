# customer-behavior-analysis
Data Analysis Project showcasing Customer Behavior Analysis using SQL, Power Bi and Python.

📊 Data Analysis of Customer Behavior

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using real-world sales data. The goal is to uncover insights such as customer spending patterns, product performance, discount impact, and key business drivers that help improve decision-making and marketing strategy.
The project implements a complete data workflow — from data cleaning and transformation to dashboard visualization and storytelling.

🧰 Tech Stack
Power BI – Dashboard creation and data visualization

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis

SQL – Data extraction, cleaning, filtering, grouping, and sorting

🚀 Key Objectives
Understand purchasing frequency and customer segmentation

Identify top-selling products and categories

Analyze discount effectiveness on conversion

Track sales trends across time periods

Identify potential growth opportunities based on customer behavior
